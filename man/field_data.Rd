\description{
An illustrative field dataset that contains a variety of variables commonly
collected in the automotive sector.

The dataset has complete information about failed and incomplete information
about intact vehicles. See 'Format' and 'Details' for further insights.
}
\details{
All vehicles were produced in 2014 and an analysis of the field data was
made at the end of 2015. At the date of analysis, there were 684 failed and
10,000 intact vehicles.

\strong{Censored vehicles}:

For censored units the service time (\code{dis}) was computed as the difference
of the date of analysis \code{"2015-12-31"} and the \code{registration_date}.

For many units the latter date is unknown. For these, the difference of the
analysis date and \code{production_date} was used to get a rough estimation of
the real service time. This uncertainty has to be considered in the subsequent
analysis (see \strong{delay in registration} in the section 'Details' of
\code{\link{mcs_delay}}).

Furthermore, due to the delay in report, the computed service time could also
be inaccurate. This uncertainty should be considered as well (see
\strong{delay in report} in the section 'Details' of \code{\link{mcs_delay}}).

The lifetime characteristic \code{mileage} is unknown for all censored units.
If an analysis is to be made for this lifetime characteristic, covered distances
for these units have to be estimated (see \code{\link{mcs_mileage}}).

\strong{Failed vehicles}:
For failed units the service time (\code{dis}) is computed as the difference
of \code{repair_date} and \code{registration_date}, which are known for all of them.
