}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector which consists of lifetime data. \code{x} is used to
specify the grid of the plot.}

\item{y}{Optional argument. If used, it is a numeric vector which consists of
failure probabilities with respect to \code{x}.}

\item{distribution}{Supposed distribution of the random variable.}

\item{title_main}{A character string which is assigned to the main title.}

\item{title_x}{A character string which is assigned to the title of the x axis.}

\item{title_y}{A character string which is assigned to the title of the y axis.}

\item{plot_method}{Package, which is used for generating the plot output.}
}
\value{
A plot object containing the layout of the probability plot.
}
\description{
This function is used to create the layout of a probability plot. It is
called inside of \link{plot_prob} to determine the appearance of the grid with
respect to the given characteristic \code{x}.
