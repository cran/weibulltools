\usage{
\method{plot_prob}{default}(
  x,
  y,
  status,
  id = rep("XXXXXX", length(x)),
  distribution = c("weibull", "lognormal", "loglogistic", "normal", "logistic", "sev"),

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector which consists of lifetime data. Lifetime
data could be every characteristic influencing the reliability of a product,
e.g. operating time (days/months in service), mileage (km, miles), load
cycles.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector which consists of estimated failure probabilities
regarding the lifetime data in \code{x}.}

\item{status}{A vector of binary data (0 or 1) indicating whether unit \emph{i}
is a right censored observation (= 0) or a failure (= 1).}

\item{id}{A character vector for the identification of every unit.}

\item{distribution}{Supposed distribution of the random variable.}

\item{title_main}{A character string which is assigned to the main title
of the plot.}

\item{title_x}{A character string which is assigned to the title of the
x axis.}

\item{title_y}{A character string which is assigned to the title of the
y axis.}

\item{title_trace}{A character string which is assigned to the trace shown in
the legend.}

\item{plot_method}{Package, which is used for generating the plot output.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to or from other methods. Currently not used.}

\value{
Returns a plot object containing the probability plot.

\description{
This function is used to apply the graphical technique of probability
plotting.
}
\details{
If \code{x} was split by \code{\link{mixmod_em}}, \code{\link{estimate_cdf}} with
method \code{"johnson"} is applied to subgroup-specific data. The
calculated plotting positions are shaped according to the determined split in
\code{\link{mixmod_em}}.

In \code{\link{mixmod_regression}} a maximum of three subgroups can be determined
and thus being plotted. The intention of this function is to give the
user a hint for the existence of a mixture model. An in-depth analysis should
be done afterwards.

The marker label for x and y are determined by the first word provided in the
argument \code{title_x} and \code{title_y} respectively, i.e. if
\code{title_x = "Mileage in km"} the x label of the marker is "Mileage".

The name of the legend entry is a combination of the \code{title_trace} and
the number of determined subgroups (if any). If \code{title_trace = "Group"}
and the data has been split in two groups, the legend entries are "Group: 1"
and "Group: 2".

# Vectors:
cycles   <- alloy$cycles
status <- alloy$status

# Probability estimation:
prob_tbl <- estimate_cdf(
  x = cycles,
  status = status,
  method = "johnson"
)

# Example 1: Probability Plot Weibull:
plot_weibull <- plot_prob(
  x = prob_tbl$x,
  y = prob_tbl$prob,
  status = prob_tbl$status,
  id = prob_tbl$id
)

# Example 2: Probability Plot Lognormal:
plot_lognormal <- plot_prob(
  x = prob_tbl$x,
  y = prob_tbl$prob,
  status = prob_tbl$status,
  id = prob_tbl$id,
  distribution = "lognormal"
)
