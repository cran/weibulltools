  id = rep("XXXXXX", length(x)),
  distribution = c("weibull", "lognormal", "loglogistic"),
  mix_output,
  title_main = "Probability Plot",

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector which consists of lifetime data. Lifetime
data could be every characteristic influencing the reliability of a product,
e.g. operating time (days/months in service), mileage (km, miles), load
cycles.}

\item{status}{A vector of binary data (0 or 1) indicating whether unit \emph{i}
is a right censored observation (= 0) or a failure (= 1).}

\item{id}{A character vector for the identification of every unit.}

\item{distribution}{Supposed distribution of the random variable.}

\item{mix_output}{A list provided by \code{\link{mixmod_regression}} or
\code{\link{mixmod_em}}, which consists of values necessary to visualize the
subgroups.The default value of \code{mix_output} is \code{NULL}.}

\item{title_main}{A character string which is assigned to the main title
of the plot.}

\item{title_x}{A character string which is assigned to the title of the
x axis.}

\item{title_y}{A character string which is assigned to the title of the
y axis.}

\item{title_trace}{A character string which is assigned to the trace shown in
the legend.}

\item{plot_method}{Package, which is used for generating the plot output.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to or from other methods. Currently not used.}

\code{plot_prob_mix()} is no longer under active development, switching to
\code{\link{plot_prob}} is recommended.

\details{
This function is used to apply the graphical technique of probability
plotting to univariate mixture models that have been separated with functions
\code{\link{mixmod_regression}} or \code{\link{mixmod_em}}.

If data has been split by \code{mixmod_em} the function \code{johnson_method}
is applied to subgroup-specific data. The calculated plotting positions are
shaped regarding the obtained split of the used splitting function.

In \code{\link{mixmod_regression}} a maximum of three subgroups can be determined
and thus being plotted. The intention of this function is to give the
user a hint for the existence of a mixture model. An in-depth analysis should
be done afterwards.

The marker label for x and y are determined by the first word provided in the
argument \code{title_x} respective \code{title_y}, i.e. if
\code{title_x = "Mileage in km"} the x label of the marker is "Mileage".

The name of the legend entry is a combination of the \code{title_trace} and the
number of determined subgroups. If \code{title_trace = "Group"} and the data
could be split in two groups, the legend entries would be "Group 1" and "Group 2".
