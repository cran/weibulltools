\title{Mixture Model Identification using Segmented Regression}
\usage{
mixmod_regression(x, ...)

\method{mixmod_regression}{wt_cdf_estimation}(
  x,
  distribution = c("weibull", "lognormal", "loglogistic"),
  conf_level = 0.95,
  k = 2,
  control = segmented::seg.control(),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{tibble} with class \code{wt_cdf_estimation} returned by \link{estimate_cdf}.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to or from other methods. Currently not used.}

\item{distribution}{Supposed distribution of the random variable.}

\item{conf_level}{Confidence level of the interval.}

\item{k}{Number of mixture components. If the data should be split in an
automated fashion, \code{k} must be set to \code{NULL}. The argument \code{fix.psi} of
\code{control} is then set to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{control}{Output of the call to \link[segmented:seg.control]{seg.control},
which is passed to \link[segmented:segmented]{segmented.lm}. See 'Examples' for usage.}
}
\value{
A list with classes \code{wt_model} and \code{wt_rank_regression} if no breakpoint
was detected. See \link{rank_regression}.

A list with classes \code{wt_model} and \code{wt_mixmod_regression} if at least one
breakpoint was determined. The length of the list depends on the number of
identified subgroups. Each list element contains the information provided by
\link{rank_regression}. In addition, the returned tibble \code{data} of each list element
only retains information on the failed units and has two more columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{q} : Quantiles of the standard distribution calculated from column \code{prob}.
\item \code{group} : Membership to the respective segment.
}

If more than one method was specified in \link{estimate_cdf}, the resulting output
is a list with classes \code{wt_model} and \code{wt_mixmod_regression_list} where each
list element has classes \code{wt_model} and \code{wt_mixmod_regression}.

\description{
This function uses piecewise linear regression to divide the data into
subgroups. See 'Details'.
}
\details{
The segmentation process is based on the lifetime realizations of failed
units and their corresponding estimated failure probabilities for which intact
items are taken into account. It is performed with the support of
\link[segmented:segmented]{segmented.lm}.

Segmentation can be done with a specified number of subgroups or in an automated
fashion (see argument \code{k}). The algorithm tends to overestimate the number of
breakpoints when the separation is done automatically (see 'Warning' in
\link[segmented:segmented]{segmented.lm}).

In the context of reliability analysis it is important that the main types of
failures can be identified and analyzed separately. These are
\itemize{
\item early failures,
\item random failures and
\item wear-out failures.
}

In order to reduce the risk of overestimation as well as being able to consider
the main types of failures, a maximum of three subgroups (\code{k = 3}) is recommended.

# Reliability data preparation:
## Data for mixture model:
data_mix <- reliability_data(
  voltage,
  x = hours,
  status = status
)

## Data for simple unimodal distribution:
data <- reliability_data(
  shock,
  x = distance,
  status = status
)

# Probability estimation with one method:
prob_mix <- estimate_cdf(
  data_mix,
  methods = "johnson"
)

prob <- estimate_cdf(
  data,
  methods = "johnson"
)

# Probability estimation for multiple methods:
prob_mix_mult <- estimate_cdf(
  data_mix,
  methods = c("johnson", "kaplan", "nelson")
)

# Example 1 - Mixture identification using k = 2 two-parametric Weibull models:
mix_mod_weibull <- mixmod_regression(
  x = prob_mix,
  distribution = "weibull",
  conf_level = 0.99,
  k = 2
)

# Example 2 - Mixture identification using k = 3 two-parametric lognormal models:
mix_mod_lognorm <- mixmod_regression(
  x = prob_mix,
  distribution = "lognormal",
  k = 3
)

# Example 3 - Mixture identification for multiple methods specified in estimate_cdf:
mix_mod_mult <- mixmod_regression(
  x = prob_mix_mult,
  distribution = "loglogistic"
)

# Example 4 - Mixture identification using control argument:
mix_mod_control <- mixmod_regression(
  x = prob_mix,
  distribution = "weibull",
  control = segmented::seg.control(display = TRUE)
)

# Example 5 - Mixture identification performs rank_regression for k = 1:
mod <- mixmod_regression(
  x = prob,
  distribution = "weibull",
  k = 1
)
