\value{
A tibble with class \code{wt_confint} containing the following
columns:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{x} : An ordered sequence of the lifetime characteristic regarding
      the failed units, starting at \code{min(x)} and ending up at \code{max(x)}.
      With \code{b_lives = c(0.01, 0.1, 0.5)} the 1\%, 10\% and 50\% quantiles
      are additionally included in \code{x}, but only if the specified
      probabilities are in the range of the estimated probabilities.
    \item \code{prob} : An ordered sequence of probabilities with specified
      \code{b_lives} included.
    \item \code{std_err} : Estimated standard errors with respect to
      \code{direction}.
    \item \code{lower_bound} : Provided, if \code{bounds} is one of
      \code{"two_sided"} or \code{"lower"}. Lower limit of the confidence region
      with respect to \code{direction}, i.e. quantiles or probabilities.
    \item \code{upper_bound} : Provided, if \code{bounds} is one of
      \code{"two_sided"} or \code{"upper"}. Upper limit of the confidence region
      with respect to \code{direction}, i.e. quantiles or probabilities.
    \item \code{distribution} : Specified distribution (determined when calling
    \code{\link{ml_estimation}}).
    \item \code{bounds} : Specified bound(s).
    \item \code{direction} : Specified direction.
    \item \code{cdf_estimation_method} : A character that is always
      \code{NA_character}. For the generic visualization functions this
      column has to be provided.

\description{
This function computes normal-approximation confidence intervals for quantiles
and failure probabilities.
}
\details{
The basis for the calculation of these confidence bounds are the standard errors
determined by the \link[=delta_method]{delta method} and hence the required
(log-)location-scale parameters as well as the variance-covariance matrix of
these have to be estimated with \link[=ml_estimation]{maximum likelihood}.

The bounds on the probability are determined by the \emph{z-procedure}. See
'References' for more information on this approach.
