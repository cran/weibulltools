\description{
This function is used to apply the graphical technique of probability
plotting. It is either applied to the output of \link{estimate_cdf}
(\code{plot_prob.wt_cdf_estimation}) or to the output of a mixture model from
\link{mixmod_regression} / \link{mixmod_em} (\code{plot_prob.wt_model}). Note that in the
latter case no distribution has to be specified because it is inferred from
the model.
}
\details{
If \code{x} was split by \link{mixmod_em}, \link{estimate_cdf} with method \code{"johnson"} is
applied to subgroup-specific data. The calculated plotting positions are
shaped according to the determined split in \link{mixmod_em}.

In \link{mixmod_regression} a maximum of three subgroups can be determined and thus
being plotted. The intention of this function is to give the user a hint for
the existence of a mixture model. An in-depth analysis should be done afterwards.

For \code{plot_method == "plotly"} the marker label for x and y are determined by
the first word provided in the argument \code{title_x} and \code{title_y} respectively,
i.e. if \code{title_x = "Mileage in km"} the x label of the marker is "Mileage".
The name of the legend entry is a combination of the \code{title_trace} and the
number of determined subgroups (if any). If \code{title_trace = "Group"} and the
data has been split in two groups, the legend entries are "Group: 1" and
"Group: 2".

\examples{
# Reliability data:
data <- reliability_data(
  alloy,
  x = cycles,
  status = status
)

# Probability estimation:
prob_tbl <- estimate_cdf(
  data,
  methods = c("johnson", "kaplan")
)

# Example 1 - Probability Plot Weibull:
plot_weibull <- plot_prob(prob_tbl)

# Example 2 - Probability Plot Lognormal:
plot_lognormal <- plot_prob(
  x = prob_tbl,
  distribution = "lognormal"
)

## Mixture identification
# Reliability data:
data_mix <- reliability_data(
  voltage,
  x = hours,
  status = status
)

prob_mix <- estimate_cdf(
  data_mix,
  methods = c("johnson", "kaplan")
)

# Example 3 - Mixture identification using mixmod_regression:
mix_mod_rr <- mixmod_regression(prob_mix)

plot_mix_mod_rr <- plot_prob(x = mix_mod_rr)

# Example 4 - Mixture identification using mixmod_em:
mix_mod_em <- mixmod_em(data_mix)

plot_mix_mod_em <- plot_prob(x = mix_mod_em)
