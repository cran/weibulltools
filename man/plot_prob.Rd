\description{
This function is used to apply the graphical technique of probability
plotting.
}
\details{
If \code{x} was split by \code{\link{mixmod_em}}, \code{\link{estimate_cdf}} with
method \code{"johnson"} is applied to subgroup-specific data. The
calculated plotting positions are shaped according to the determined split in
\code{\link{mixmod_em}}.

In \code{\link{mixmod_regression}} a maximum of three subgroups can be determined
and thus being plotted. The intention of this function is to give the
user a hint for the existence of a mixture model. An in-depth analysis should
be done afterwards.

The marker label for x and y are determined by the first word provided in the
argument \code{title_x} and \code{title_y} respectively, i.e. if
\code{title_x = "Mileage in km"} the x label of the marker is "Mileage".

The name of the legend entry is a combination of the \code{title_trace} and
the number of determined subgroups (if any). If \code{title_trace = "Group"}
and the data has been split in two groups, the legend entries are "Group: 1"
and "Group: 2".

\examples{
# Reliability data:
data <- reliability_data(
  alloy,
  x = cycles,
  status = status
)

# Probability estimation:
prob_tbl <- estimate_cdf(
  data,
  methods = c("johnson", "kaplan")
)

# Example 1 - Probability Plot Weibull:
plot_weibull <- plot_prob(prob_tbl)

# Example 2 - Probability Plot Lognormal:
plot_lognormal <- plot_prob(
  x = prob_tbl,
  distribution = "lognormal"
)

## Mixture identification
# Reliability data:
data_mix <- reliability_data(
  voltage,
  x = hours,
  status = status
)

prob_mix <- estimate_cdf(
  data_mix,
  methods = c("johnson", "kaplan")
)

# Example 3 - Mixture identification using mixmod_regression:
mix_mod_rr <- mixmod_regression(prob_mix)

plot_mix_mod_rr <- plot_prob(x = mix_mod_rr)

# Example 4 - Mixture identification using mixmod_em:
mix_mod_em <- mixmod_em(data_mix)

plot_mix_mod_em <- plot_prob(x = mix_mod_em)
