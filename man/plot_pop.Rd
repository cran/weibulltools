\title{Add Population Line(s) to an Existing Grid}
\usage{
plot_pop(
  p_obj = NULL,
  x,
  dist_params_tbl,
  distribution = c("weibull", "lognormal", "loglogistic", "normal", "logistic", "sev"),
  tol = 1e-06,
  title_trace = "Population",
  plot_method = c("plotly", "ggplot2")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{p_obj}{A plot object to which the population lines are added or
\code{NULL}. If \code{NULL} the population lines are plotted in an empty grid.}

\item{x}{A numeric vector of length two or greater used for the x coordinates
of the population line. If \code{length(x) == 2} a sequence of length 200
between \code{x[1]} and \code{x[2]} is created. This sequence is equidistant
with respect to the scale of the x axis. If \code{length(x) > 2} the elements
of \code{x} are the x coordinates of the population line.}

\item{dist_params_tbl}{A tibble. See 'Details'.}

\item{distribution}{Supposed distribution of the random variable. In the
context of this function \code{"weibull"}, \code{"lognormal"} and
\code{"loglogistic"} stand for the two- \strong{and} the three-parametric
version of the respective distribution. The distinction is made via
\code{dist_params_tbl}.}

\item{tol}{The failure probability is restricted to the interval
\eqn{[tol, 1 - tol]}. The default value is in accordance with the decimal
places shown in the hover for \code{plot_method = "plotly"}.}

\item{title_trace}{A character string which is assigned to the trace shown in
the legend.}

\item{plot_method}{Plot package, which produces the visual output. Only
used with \code{p_obj = NULL}, otherwise \code{p_obj} is used to determine
the plot method.}
}
\value{
A plot object which contains the linearized CDF(s).
}
\description{
This function adds one or multiple linearized CDFs to an existing plot grid.
}
\details{
\code{dist_params_tbl} is a data.frame with two or three columns. For
location-scale distributions the first column contains the location parameter
and the second column contains the scale parameter. For three-parametric
distributions the third column contains the threshold parameter.

If only one population line should be displayed, a numeric vector of length
two or three is also supported (\code{c(loc, sc)} or \code{c(loc, sc, thres)}).

\examples{
x <- rweibull(n = 100, shape = 1, scale = 20000)

# Example 1 - Two-parametric straight line:
pop_weibull <- plot_pop(
  p_obj = NULL,
  x = range(x),
  dist_params_tbl = c(log(20000), 1),
  distribution = "weibull"
)

# Example 2 - Three-parametric curved line:
x2 <- rweibull(n = 100, shape = 1, scale = 20000) + 5000

pop_weibull_2 <- plot_pop(
  p_obj = NULL,
  x = x2,
  dist_params_tbl = c(log(20000 - 5000), 1, 5000),
  distribution = "weibull"
)

# Example 3 - Multiple lines:
pop_weibull_3 <- plot_pop(
  p_obj = NULL,
  x = x,
  dist_params_tbl = data.frame(
    p_1 = c(log(20000), log(20000), log(20000)),
    p_2 = c(1, 1.5, 2)
    ),
  distribution = "weibull",
  plot_method = "ggplot2"
)

# Example 4 - Compare two- and three-parametric distributions:
pop_weibull_4 <- plot_pop(
  p_obj = NULL,
  x = x,
  dist_params_tbl = data.frame(
    param_1 = c(log(20000), log(20000)),
    param_2 = c(1, 1),
    param_3 = c(NA, 2)
  ),
  distribution = "weibull"
