\title{High Voltage Stress Test for the Dielectric Insulation of Generator armature bars}
\format{
A tibble with 58 rows and 3 variables:
\describe{
  \item{hours}{Observed hours.}
  \item{failure_mode}{
    One of two failure modes (\code{D} and \code{E})
    or \code{censored} if no failure occurred.
  }
  \item{status}{
    If \code{failure_mode} is either \code{D} or \code{E}
    this is \code{1} else \code{0}.

\description{
A sample of 58 segments of bars were subjected to a high voltage stress test.
Two failure modes occurred, Mode D (degradation failure) and Mode E (early failure).
