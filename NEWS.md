# weibulltools (development version)

## Breaking Changes

### Parametric Models
* `rank_regression()`: For all distributions, the confidence intervals of the parameters are now computed on the basis of a heteroscedasticity-consistent (HC) covariance matrix. If the confidence intervals for the Weibull parameters are to be calculated according to *Mock*, this must be specified via the new argument `options`.  
* `mixmod_regression()`: Since this function uses `rank_regression()`, the changes regarding the confidence intervals also apply here. 
* `plot_prob.wt_model()`: Removed dysfunctional argument `distribution`. The distribution is inferred using the model `x`.

### Confidence Intervals
* `delta_method()`: Renamed argument `p` with `x`. 
* `confint_betabinom()` and `confint_fisher()`: Removed constant features `distribution`, `bounds` and `direction` from the tibble output and added them as attributes instead.

### Monte Carlo Simulation
* `mcs_mileage()`: Changed name of output column `mileage` to `x` (in accordance with `reliability_data()`).
* `mcs_delay()`: Changed name of output column `time` to `x` (in accordance with `reliability_data()`). 
* `dist_mileage.default()` (former `dist_mileage()`): Renamed argument `mileage` with `x`.
* `mcs_mileage.default()` (former `mcs_mileage()`): Renamed argument `mileage` with `x`.

## New Features

### Distributions 
* Implementation of one- and two-parametric exponential distribution (`'exponential'` and `'exponential2'`).

### Non-Parametric Failure Probabilities
* `estimate_cdf()`: Added option `johnson_method` to specify the formula which is used for determining cumulative failure probabilities.

### Parametric Models
* `rank_regression()`: New arguments `direction` (specifies direction of dependency in the model), `control` (enables access to argument `control` in `optim()`) and `options` (method used to calculate the confidence intervals for the parameters, default is "HC").  
* `r_squared_profiling()`: New argument `direction`. 
* `ml_estimation()`: New arguments `start_dist_params` (optional vector with initial values of the parameters) and `control` (enables access to argument `control` in `optim()`).
* `loglik_profiling()`: New argument `wts`. 
* `loglik_profiling()` is now an S3 generic. `loglik_profiling()` becomes `loglik_profiling.default()`. Added `loglik_profiling.wt_reliability_data()`.
* `loglik_function()` is now an S3 generic. `loglik_function()` becomes `loglik_function.default()`. Added `loglik_function.wt_reliability_data()`.

### Confidence Intervals
* `confint_betabinom()`: Methods `"kaplan"` and `"nelson"` of `estimate_cdf()` can be used for beta-binomial confidence bounds.

### Monte Carlo Simulation
* Added `mcs_mileage_data()`: Create consistent MCS data for `mcs_mileage()`.
* Added `mcs_delay_data()`: Create consistent MCS data for `mcs_delay()`.
* `dist_mileage()` is now an S3 generic. `dist_mileage()` becomes `dist_mileage.default()`. Added `dist_mileage.wt_mcs_mileage_data()`.

* `dist_delay()` now supports the estimation of multiple delay distributions at once. 
* `mcs_mileage()` is now an S3 generic. `mcs_mileage()` becomes `mcs_mileage.default()`. Added `mcs_mileage.wt_mcs_mileage_data()`.
* `mcs_delay()` is now an S3 generic. `mcs_delay()` becomes `mcs_delay.default()`. Added `mcs_delay.wt_mcs_delay_data()`.
* Added `print.wt_mcs_delay_data()` and `print.wt_mcs_mileage_data()`.

## Lifecycle changes

## Minor Improvements and bug fixes

### Reliability Data 
* Fixed bug in `reliability_data()`: Using `!!` syntax with arguments `x` and `status` resulted in an error.
* `estimate_cdf()` preserves additional columns, that were returned from `reliability_data(..., .keep_all = TRUE)`.
* Improved `print.wt_reliability_data()`.

### Confidence Intervals
* Fixed bug in `plot_conf()`: Wrong confidence bounds were displayed for `direction = "x"` (#181). 
* Fixed bug in `plot_conf()`: `plot_method = "ggplot2"` and exactly one method in `estimate_cdf()` resulted in an error (#182).

### Monte Carlo Simulation
* The object returned by `mcs_mileage()` now has class `wt_mcs_mileage`.
* The object returned by `mcs_delay()` now has class `wt_mcs_delay`. 
* The object returned by `dist_mileage()` now has class `wt_mileage_estimation`. 
* The object returned by `dist_delay()` now has class `wt_delay_estimation` or `wt_delay_estimation_list`. 

## Documentation improvements
* `plot_prob()`: Better work out the distinction between `plot_prob.wt_cdf_estimation()` and `plot_prob.wt_model()`. The former is applied to a CDF estimation whereas the latter is applied to a mixture model.

* Fixed installation error when using clang compiler

# weibulltools 1.0.0 

## Prerequisite for Package Usage:

* Since RcppArmadillo is used, the R version should be at least 3.3.0 
  (listed under Depends in DESCRIPTION file)
  
## Changes

* Vignettes for non-parametric probability estimation, parameter estimation using Median-Rank Regression and Maximum-Likelihood and mixture model estimation are provided. 
* Argument _y_ in functions `plot_prob_mix()` and `plot_mod_mix()` is deprecated and not used anymore. 
* Argument *reg_output* in functions `plot_prob_mix()` and `plot_mod_mix()` is deprecated; use *mix_output* instead. 
* Function `plot_mod_mix()` was revised and updated in the way that the obtained results of the function `mixmod_em()` can be visualized. 
* Function `plot_prob_mix()` was revised and updated in the way that the obtained results of the function `mixmod_em()` can be visualized. 
* Implementation of EM-Algorithm using Newton-Raphson. The algorithm is written in c++ (`mixture_em_cpp()`) and is called in `mixmod_em()`. 
* New method for the computation of Fisher's Confidence Bounds regarding probabilities is used. These method is called "z-Procedure" and is more appropriate to manage the bend-back behavior. Therefore an adjustment of functions `delta_method()` and `confint_fisher()` was made. 
* Implementation of log-location-scale models with threshold parameter like three-parametric Weibull ("weibull3"), three-parametric lognormal ("lognormal3") and three-parametric loglogistic ("loglogistic3"). 
* Implementation of location-scale models like smallest extreme value ("sev"), normal ("normal") and logistic ("logistic"). 
* Implementation of _Log-Likelihood Profiling_ for three-parametric models in function `loglik_profiling()`. In general this function is used inside `ml_estimation()` for the purpose of estimating threshold parameter of three-parametric models. 
* Implementation of _R-Squared Profiling_ for three-parametric models in function `r_squared_profiling()`. In general this function is used inside `rank_regression()` for the purpose of estimating threshold parameter of three-parametric models.
* Implementation of _Log-Likelihood Function_ for all implemented models in function `loglik_function()`. In general this function is used inside `ml_estimation()` for the purpose of estimating the variance-covariance matrix of location-scale models "sev", "normal" and "logistic". The function is also used to estimate the variance-covariance matrix of log-location-scale models with a threshold parameter, i.e. "weibull3", "lognormal3" and "loglogistic3".
* new argument in function `ml_estimation()`: `wts` for case weights.
