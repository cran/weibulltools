#' Field Data
#'
#' @description
#' An illustrative field dataset that contains a variety of variables commonly
#' collected in the automotive sector.
#'
#' The dataset has complete information about failed and incomplete information
#' about intact vehicles. See 'Format' and 'Details' for further insights.
#'
#' @details
#' All vehicles were produced in 2014 and an analysis of the field data was
#' made at the end of 2015. At the date of analysis, there were 684 failed and
#' 10,000 intact vehicles.
#'
#' \strong{Censored vehicles}:
#'
#' For censored units the service time (\code{dis}) was computed as the difference
#' of the date of analysis \code{"2015-12-31"} and the \code{registration_date}.
#'
#' For many units the latter date is unknown. For these, the difference of the
#' analysis date and \code{production_date} was used to get a rough estimation of
#' the real service time. This uncertainty has to be considered in the subsequent
#' analysis (see \strong{delay in registration} in the section 'Details' of
#' \code{\link{mcs_delay}}).
#'
#' Furthermore, due to the delay in report, the computed service time could also
#' be inaccurate. This uncertainty should be considered as well (see
#' \strong{delay in report} in the section 'Details' of \code{\link{mcs_delay}}).
#'
#' The lifetime characteristic \code{mileage} is unknown for all censored units.
#' If an analysis is to be made for this lifetime characteristic, covered distances
#' for these units have to be estimated (see \code{\link{mcs_mileage}}).
#'
#' \strong{Failed vehicles}:
#' For failed units the service time (\code{dis}) is computed as the difference
#' of \code{repair_date} and \code{registration_date}, which are known for all of them.

#'   \item{vin}{Vehicle identification number.}
